### Overview:

This project creates a guessing game that helps the user meet the author. The intended flow is:

1. It promts() the user with a question about the Author
2. The quesion is converted to lower case for comparison
3. The function then compares the user guess to the answer stored in the array
4. There are three outcomes:
	1. The user guesses correctly and a positive alert informs them,
	2. The user guesses incorrectly and it matches the anticipated incorrect answer, a alert informs the user
	3. The user guesses something that is not specified, an alert informs the user of the correct and anticipated incorrect answer

### Function: js/class04.js

This file contains all the necessary javascript for the classFour() function. It also contains qArray which contains the question and answer data.

	* classFour(qArray) is the intended use.
