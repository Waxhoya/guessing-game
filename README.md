# Code Fellows Project/Portfolio

This is an html/CSS/JS sandbox intended to be used from index.html.

### Javascript Functions:

1. randGame() calls a random integer guessing game
2. myHistory() calls a "What would you do" game
3. getTrivia() is attached as a placeholder to class04
4. getTrivia() runs through the obj array to ask and test question answers
5. compareENator() sterilizes user input into a single lower case char[0]

### Limits

getTrivia() uses compareENator() to truncates the user input into the first char transformed to lowercase. Chars outside the first are exluded. Potentially incorrect answers could be accepted or visa versa.

##### Background
The background is new PDX carpet pattern and the solid colors have been picked out of the background image.
